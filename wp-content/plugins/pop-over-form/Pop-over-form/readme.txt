// SIMPLE POPOVER FORM by http://www.signupto.com //

Requires Fancybox http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/
Requires JQuery jquery.org/license

// IMPORTANT: These scripts are provided as-is and without warranty of any kind. //

This script will display a form in a pop-over dialogue 15 seconds after a user enters a page.
A cookie is then set which will prevent the form from displaying for another 14 days.
The form URL, size, delay and days to hid can all be configured.

All configuration takes place in formBox.js

The most important value to set is 'formURL' - the URL of the form you wish to show. 
All other settings can be left at their default.

JQuery and the Fancybox plugin are required for operation. 
These are included in this file, if you already have these on your site you can remove the inclusion tags from the code in example.html

Open example.html to see it in action. 
The cookie set is called 'popForm' - when testing on live you will need to delete this cookie form your browser to view the form again.
